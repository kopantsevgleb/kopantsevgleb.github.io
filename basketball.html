				<h1>Basketball</h1>
				<p>Basketball is a big part of my life and I have played this sport since the age of ten. One day, a coach from a sports school came to my school and invite me to the basketball practice. That's how it started. With the help of the basketball, i travelled a lot and visited many new countries and cities for myself.
				Troughout my life, I played in US for two different schools, Florida Prep and Florida Nation Academy. Finally, after this I came to the LCC International University, where I'm combining my athletics with the education.
