				<h1>Experience</h1>
				<p>On my personalwebsite, I also want to share with you my working experience. I showed three examples below, where i worked officially. Nevertheless, there were some part time jobs, where I worked unofficial as well. I came to a conclusion that working intellectually is much better, than just physical same work. For example, when you work as a server. Finally, it is all about salary, but I would definitely encourage you to find the job, which will bring only joy to you.</p>
